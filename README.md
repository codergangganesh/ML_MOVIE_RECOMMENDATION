# ML_MOVIE_RECOMMENDATION
Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning with Python helps to follow the movie Expectations.
This project is a content-based and collaborative filtering movie recommendation system built using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Surprise. The system analyzes user preferences and movie metadata to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy.

üöÄ Features
Content-Based Filtering using genres, keywords, cast, and crew

Collaborative Filtering using user ratings with Surprise library (SVD, KNN, etc.)

Hybrid Recommendation approach combining both methods

Similarity Measures with cosine similarity and Pearson correlation

Clean and interactive CLI-based interface (can be extended to web using Flask or Streamlit)

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Surprise (for collaborative filtering)

NLTK / SpaCy (for text processing, optional)

Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
